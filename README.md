## Game details:

In this game a player have to pass the obstacle course with different challenging obstacles which may push player off the ground into the abyss.

The level is small, but holds many moving and rotating objects interfering a player to pass through to the end of the track.

## What I learned during game development process:

- Camera actor modifying and field of view settings
- Manipulating actors behaviour at the game runtime such as moving and rotating
- Character customisation
- Tick function and DeltaTime variable
- UPROPERTY variable, structs and functions calling in C++
- Scope resolution operator
- Unreal game mode settings
<br />

#### The game was developed in scope of [Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/) on Udemy.
